                <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
                <p>Like most website operators, appoint collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. appoint’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how appoint’s visitors use its website. From time to time, appoint may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <hr />
                
                <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>Certain visitors to appoint’s websites choose to interact with appoint in ways that require appoint to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that appoint gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at appoint.io to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with appoint – by purchasing access to the premium features – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, appoint collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with appoint. appoint does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                <hr />

                <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                <p>appoint may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. appoint may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, appoint does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                <hr />

                <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>appoint discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on appoint’s behalf or to provide services available at appoint’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using appoint’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. appoint will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, appoint discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when appoint believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of appoint, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a appoint website and have supplied your email address, appoint may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with appoint and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. appoint takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. appoint uses cookies to help appoint identify and track visitors, their usage of appoint website, and their website access preferences. appoint visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using appoint’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of appoint’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                <hr />

                <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>If appoint, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that appoint goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of appoint may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
                <hr />

                <h3>Ads</h3>
                <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by appoint and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                <hr />

                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, appoint may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in appoint’s sole discretion. appoint encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a appoint.io account, you should also check your account’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
